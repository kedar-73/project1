Transmission Line Simulation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a matlab transmission line simulation program. To run the 
transmission line simulation, you must be in this folder and then type "tline_sim" into the command window without the quotes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

tline_sim.m is the transmission line simulation GUI file.

transient_tline.m is the transient transmission line model.

steady_state_tline.m is the steady state transmission line model.

The images folder contains images that are used in the simulation.

The config_files folder stores preconfigured simulation files that can be
loaded from within the simulation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Symbolic Math Toolbox is required for the transient transmission line
model to work
